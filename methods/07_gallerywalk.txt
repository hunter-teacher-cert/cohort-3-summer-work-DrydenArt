Methods Summer 2022
GALLERY TOUR LOG



====================================================
DISCOVERIES:
* I learned that I can create html and css files in replit from Marisa Shuman, and then push it to GitHub the way we have been all year.  
* I learned how to insert a block of code from Kate Maschmeyer.
*Kate M. and Sam Lojacono helped me fix my page links - I had too much of the file location, I just needed the file name. 
*Kate M. took us on an amazing tour of how she uses Replit and GitHub when designing lessons and distributing them with her students.  It was amazing!  I provided her additional link below.  


LINGERING QUESTIONS:
* I feel a little overwhelmed sometimes when I see these amazing resources from all the very experienced CS teachers.  
* It's hard to know where to start.


COMMENTS/CONCERNS/OTHER:
* Color on a website is very appealing and inviting.  This is a good argument for working with html/css rather than strictly GitHub pages.
* The site navigation needs to be intuitive.
* It's important that the content is organized in a way that isn't overwhelming.
* Simplicity and clarity is a good way to empower students to find things on their own.

I enjoy the way she included her code blocks.
The link for her students looks fun, organized, and easy to use.

notable site: Jenna Lin
https://sites.google.com/whbschools.org/linj/
notable aspect: It's beautiful and inviting - colors and shapes that are irristible
Also: while the site is colorful, it's not messy or distracting.
Simple and clear with intuitive navigation.
https://jenna0704.github.io/nycscertweb/
notable aspect: the checklist is really nice.  Could use for standards met within each lesson (as a way to inform students, and a way to connect to admin)
-------------------------------------
notable site: Greg Sciame
https://sites.google.com/a/hstat.org/10sep1617/p5js
notable aspect: easy to navigate, super organized.
This site looks more grown-up due to the more streamlined interface.
This site has a ton of information, not only for students to access each lesson, but also to access/use the resources afterwards.

notable site: David Moste
https://dmoste.github.io/nycscertweb/
notable aspect:  simplicity, but with a fun aspect that doesn't interfere with or distract from the content.
-------------------------------------
notable sites: Adam Driggers
https://awdriggs.github.io/nycscertweb/
notable aspect: the animation clips included.  
Also: Showing animations with content can help scaffold understanding of content, or at least give a sneak peak of the product/possiblites of coding
-------------------------------------
notable sites: Marike Thomas
https://marieke-thomas.github.io/nycscertweb/
notable aspects:  the CS jokes she added
Also: I think it's important to create that "inside joke" culture within a group of students to make everyone feel connected.  
And, also, it's better to laugh than to cry in CS
