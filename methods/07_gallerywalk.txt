Methods Summer 2022
GALLERY TOUR LOG



====================================================
DISCOVERIES:
* I learned that I can create html and css in replit from Marisa Shuman, and then push it to GitHub the way we have been all year.  
* I learned how to insert a block of code from Kate Maschmeyer.
*Kate M. and Sam L. helped me fix my page links - I had too much of the file location, I just needed the file name. 
*Kate M. took us on an amazing tour of how she uses Replit and GitHub when designing lessons and distributing them with her students.  It was amazing!  


LINGERING QUESTIONS:
* I feel a little overwhelmed sometimes when I see these amazing resources from all the very experienced teachers.  It's hard to know where to start.


COMMENTS/CONCERNS/OTHER:
* Color on a website is very appealing and inviting.  This is a good argument for working with html/css rather than strictly GitHub pages.
* The site navigation needs to be intuitive.
* It's important that the content is organized in a way that isn't overwhelming.
* Simplicity and clarity is a good way to empower students to find things on their own.
