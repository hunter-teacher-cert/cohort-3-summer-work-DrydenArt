# Community Building Techniques
#### written with collaborative input from Team hashtagBEGUDFAM
Roster: Elizabeth Rechtin, Jenna Lin, Ed Hawkins and Greg Sciame

### School Environment
* school size: 424 high school students
* school grade range: 9-12
* faculty count: 0 (Soon to be 3)
* courses:
  * Programming: Python (Math Department), Fall 2022
  * Other: Digital Media Arts, Graphic Design, Video Production, Intro to Computers

* * *

### Club: Xcode

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* students can drop in and get connected 
* students can get deeper into projects or languages introduced in classes
* students will drive it
* students will introduce concepts they are interested in and comfortable with leading

#### Rollout Timeline
* This won't take long to initiate since it's already in existence, it's just been dormant.
* Need to begin announcing it again and inviting students.
  

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Students attending and then returning
* Students inviting other students
* Students taking the lead on club activities

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* This may need to start out as teacher led, with the goal of students leading...a hurdle is to foster the shift from TL to SL
* Lack of support from district leadership
* Marketing/Communication: Students not knowing the club is a thing, not getting the word out successfully

* * *

### Initiative: Week of Code, or Hour of Code

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* increases visibility of a coding community
* engages the whole school community, creates culture
* generates fun for all (even spectators)
* it could be interesting to add criteria:
  * teams have to include at least one teacher/staff/administrator/parent...to engage the whole community
  * teacher teams vs. student teams
  * as per Ashley Ufret's idea of making sure the events are posted on the school sites/social media so that parents and community members start inquiring about CS for their students

#### Rollout Timeline
* This would take time to build some literacy within the building
* Maybe a goal for next year, once we've had a year of classes and Xcode

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Early on:  if there are participants
* Later on:  if the event generates it's own community anticipation where teams form themselves and practice together, or a network of enthusiasm forms

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* ( if any... )

* * *

### Classroom Environment
* courses: Digital Media Arts, Graphic Design, Motion Graphics, Video Production
* future courses wish list:  app development, game design (my vision is that this would be a course taught by multiple CS teachers collaboratively)
* grade level: 9 - 12, mixed level classes
* prior run count: DMA run annualy (foundation), GD and VP run semi-annually (upper level)

* * *

### Course: Digital Media Arts

#### How it Works
* Introduction to Processing
* Simple enough not to require a background in programming, but has the capacity to engage those students who do have the background
* This will help to support an upper level programming course offered through the Math department that students can take in the future.

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* students will have a positive experience early in their HS career
* students will build confidence and interest
* fun

#### Rollout Timeline
* I will introduce this in the 2022/2023 school year.
* I need to consider the best timing for this activity

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Student feedback, with general teacher observation throughout lesson
* Increased participation in Xcode
* Laughter in class
* Future, more student interest in other CS course in the HS

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Next year, our school has opted for 38 minute classes.  To me this is a hurdle for all classes everywhere.

* * *

### Class Routine: Creating Classroom Culture
#### Approaches
* Student surveys, some questions re: personality and other things for grouping
* Students introduce each other to the class, I model this with an implicit "rubber duck" framework
* Kate M.'s I am a Robot idea, where students have to provide directions to me and I have to do it.  I already do similar things like this in class to support group culture
* CS Lunchtime Lab (idea shared by Wayne Tobias)
