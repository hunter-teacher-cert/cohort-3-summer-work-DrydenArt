 # Collaborative Gallery Walk of Websites

## Background and Timing:
* This lesson is part of a Graphic Design course at the HS level. 
* The gallery walk begins the unit on webpage development/HTML and CSS.
* This unit is introduced in the second semester; students have worked together through the first semester learning Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
* Class culture: contributing to an atmosphere of productivity and professionalism is introduced at the beginning of the year and reinforced throughout.
* Typically, students enrolled in this course are intrinsically motivated. 

## Provided:
* Students are given a list of websites with heinous, mediocre and amazing websites to explore.
* Each group has a different set of websites to explore. 


## First Grouping: 
Given that students have created a productive work environment through out the year: 
* Students may self-select into pairs to share their selected websites together.
* Otherwise: students will be paired based on who they haven't worked with yet.

## Student Roles:
* One student will navigate the sites
* The other student will record what they observe about how each site is constructed
* Both students will make observations and discuss the components of each site

## Student Tasks:
1. Select the roles each person will take.
2. Generate the idea catcher (ie: a Google Doc for notes).
3. Explore each of the sites making observations in four categories:
    * Aesthetics
    * Organization
    * Navigation
    * Categories
4. Be prepared to present your findings in a digestible format.

## Benefits of Group Work:
* Student ownership of their discoveries, ie: constructing their own knowlege
* More eyes = more observations
* Improvement in student confidence to complete the task
* Benefits of social connections while working
* Generates group knowledge

## Mechanisms for Gauging Success:
* Listening to hear if students are discussing on topic.
* Looking to see their document content grow.
* Check ins with groups to answer questions, provide positive feedback and support their team cohesion.

## Troublesome Roadblocks:
* Support struggling teams with guiding questions:
  * How are you introduced to the site?  
  * How did you figure out what to do/where to go next?
  * What's your impression of the design/layout of the site?  
  * How do you know where to go or what to do on the site?
  * How do go deeper into the site? Or get back out?
  * How do you find what youâ€™re looking for?
  * Is the process consistent from page to page?
  * What are the actual titles of the links or buttons?
  * Are they easy to understand?
  * What kinds of things can you find on this site?
* Provide skeleton for notetaking if a team is stuck on how to record.
* Rubric based on individual and group metrics, with aspect of promoting an atmosphere of professionalism.
* Visit another group to observe their process. 



## Long Term Goals and Future Groupings: 
* Small Group Project: Students will be grouped again in small teams for designing and developing a Fake Business website together (using the design process):
  * Researh and ideation
  * Diagramming the site on paper
  * Building the site together
  * User testing with other groups
  * Redesign, fixing errors, getting the glam on the site
* Independent Project: Students will design a personal portfolio site and will continue to be grouped together throughout the design process to give feedback to each other on functionality and design, as mentioned above.
