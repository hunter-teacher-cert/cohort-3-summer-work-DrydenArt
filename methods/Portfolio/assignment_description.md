# Lesson Plan Final Project
You may work alone, or in groups of up to 3 people. The last 2 days of class will be set aside for working on your plans, including space to discuss and demo with others if desired.
# Task:
Students are to create two detailed lesson plans, with supporting materials for computer science lessons. 

Each lesson plan should include a description of the intended student audience and a detailed explanation of how multiple pedagogical techniques can be used in delivering the lesson. 

(For example, if the lesson includes subgoal labeling, the project should include the finished desired code along with the subgoal labels included within.)


Each lesson plan should demonstrate different pedagogical techniques presented during the course, though there may be some overlap between the two lesson plans.

The plans can be sequential, or entirely separate.

The completed assignment should be such that the two lesson plans can be given to any computer science teacher and they could deliver the lessons as intended.
