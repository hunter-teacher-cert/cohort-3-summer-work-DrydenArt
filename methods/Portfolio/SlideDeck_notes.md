Building prior knowledge:
Objective: Students will practice writing directions to complete a task
Objective: Students will use iterative practices to develop language that a computer will understand
Objective: Students will experience the difference between the way a computer thinks vs. the way a human thinks

Warm Up: How many of you like PBJ (may need to define this)?
10 minutes:  In small groups, students will collaboratively write a set of directions on how to make a PBJ (Protocol: create team name, establish roles, complete task)
15 minutes:  Test the program - students will give directions verbally and the teacher will follow the directions.  
5 minutes: Student teams will re-write the directions for clarity. 
5 minutes:  Final test. 
Summary:  When we write directions for computers, there are things that we can do that computers canâ€™t do.  We must consider these differences when developing directions (or computer programs).  When a set of instructions is unclear to a computer, we rework the instructions to fix the problem (bug).

## Slide 3 and 4

How do we tell the computer to do something?
Day 2

Warm Up
Question: In what ways was the PBJ activity like computer programming?

Lesson Content
* Introduction of what computer programming is with diagramming connections on the board.
* Go over the terms: programming language, syntax and algorithm.
* See [vocabulary document](01_Vocabulary.md).
* Introduce p5.js and it's origins with a diagram of how it connects. See [drawing document](p5_origins.draw).

## Slide 5
* **Silent Thinking:** 
Students take 2 - 5 minutes to look at and think about these blocks of code and consider what they think it will do.  Students can jot down their ideas if they choose to.
## Slide 6
How to add comments
* **Teacher:** defines code block and demonstrates how to make comments in code.
## Slide 7
Talk it out
Draw it out
//Write it out
Names on the deliverable, please
## Slide 8
Demo & Discussion
## Slide 9
TEST IT OUT!
In your teams, open the p5.js interface on your own device.
Work collaboratively to make changes and experiment with the code. 

  Deliverable:
Create a program that makes a canvas  500 pixels high, 700 pixels wide.
Comments in the code should reflect your understanding of which argument controls which.
Challenge: create a background that is purple
