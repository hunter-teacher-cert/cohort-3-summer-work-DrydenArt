# Debug Lesson

## What is a bug?
The term "bug" is used to describe problems and has been a part of engineering jargon since the 1870s. The term was used before computers were invented.

In 1946, Grace Hopper traced an error in the Mark II, an early computer, to a moth trapped in the computer which caused a problem. This bug was carefully removed and taped into the log book. From this first actual bug, today we call errors or glitches in a program a bug.

## Type of Bugs
**Syntax Errors:** As programmers, we often make mistakes and introduce bugs in our code with bad syntax. These are often found by the compiler. 

**Logic Errors:** Logic errors WON'T be caught by the compiler. They happen when our logic is wrong. Maybe we should have used a `>=` instead of `>`. Logic errors are harder to find and it is helpful to use print statements to track down these types of errors. 

## Your Task
* This function has 1 syntax and 2 logic errors.
* Use `System.out.println();` to track down the bugs.
  * For example this statement `System.out.println("index: " + i);` would print the value of i for each step of the for loop.
* Compile and run each time you add a statement to see what prints, and help you find and fix the errors. 

```java
 public static int findMaxValue( int[] data ) {
    int m=0;  
    for (int i = 0; i >= data.length; i++){
      if (data[i]<m){
        m = data{i};
      }
    }

    return m;
  }
```

* Use the starter file `arrayBugs.java`.
* When you find an error, fix it, then write a comment saying whether it was a logic error or syntax error.
* If you finish, become an expert. Travel around the room helping others. Don't give away answers! Lead students with questions.
