Data Structure design challenge

Structure:  ArrayList (data type: person objects)

We need to have some kind of a find method, which seems like a binarySearch would be the most efficient (n log n time)

We'd most often be adding names into the middle, and only rarely would we need to add them to the beginning or ends
